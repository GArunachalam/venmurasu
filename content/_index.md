My name is **Ganesan Arunachalam**

There isn't particularly anything interesting about me other than that I am a fan of writer [Jeyamohan](https://jeyamohan.in).

The site is primarily about analyzing [Venmurasu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venmurasu) and publishing some interesting facts about it.  The official website for Venmurasu is [here](https://venmurasu.in).

Questions, comments, suggestions? Reach me at garunachalam+vmanalysis@gmail.com
